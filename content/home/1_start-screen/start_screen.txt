Body-text:

Welcome to the online pricing algorithm for Accolade.   By answering a series of questions designed to measure various factors which effect a person’s chances of achieving societal success you will be presented with a personalised price adjusted according to the responses.  

All questions are optional and those who might often find themselves penalised in the various games that society plays may be rewarded with significant discounts.

Once you have been presented with the personalised price you can decide whether or not you would like to purchase the artwork.

All data other than the final price and selected trophy size will be automatically deleted [insert time frame? Daily etc.].

You must be 18 or over to participate.
