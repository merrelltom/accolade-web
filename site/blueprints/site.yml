# The site blueprint must have a title, the title may be different from the file name
# The `site.yml` blueprint defines the look of the start page (Dashboard) of the Panel.
title: Site

# The site blueprint usually provides easy access to all main pages of the site.
# In this example blueprint, we also show subpages of the `photography` and `notes` pages.
# More about the site blueprint: https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/blueprints/site

# The layout of this form has two columns:
columns:
  # The first column has one section for the subpages of the `photography` page in card layout
  # It reuses the pages section defined in `/site/blueprints/sections/albums.yml`
